# Unit tests for Lab assignment 3

### This folder contains unit tests for lab assignment 3. Since lab 3 contains 2 questions, I have created separate test for both questions.

 

_Unit testing is an important skill and you should try to incorporate it in your assignments and projects also. Start with a small scale test suite (1 or 2 tests), then move gradually forward._
