# Sample solutions for lab assignments(CS-201)

### Important notes:

1. This repository contains the sample solutions for lab assignments. Treat the sample code as a guide that will make your code better and also teach you some c++ advanced concepts along the way.

2. You are only required to follow the instructions from the coding style guide. The rest of the features and techniques used in these solutions are just for reference. 

3. You are not required to submit similar code. We understand that expecting similar code from you won't be practical. Rather you can learn a few thing from these solutions and incorporate them in your next assignments.

4. I have also added unit tests. Unit testing is an essential skills for software engineers. You are not required to write unit tests and not advised to submit them in your assignements. You can however use unit testing at a small scale to make your programs more error free and robust. This skill takes time to learn. So don't get disheartened if this is too much for you.

5. The C++ version used in these assignments are c++ 14. If you are using a lower version of c++, consider updating to a higher version as some of the features (lambda expressions, range-based loops) may not work in your system.

#### check c++ version:
`g++ --version`

_if it is >= 9, c++ 14 is supported._
